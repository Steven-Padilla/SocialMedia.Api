# SocialMedia (API)

This is the api for the Social Media that i'm building.

I'm making this project, because i have some doubts about "sequelize", that is a ORM for nodejs. I wanted to try this orm, because i used to create apis without orm. 

On the way, i also wanted to improve my skills with javaScript, mainly, coding with good practices.
I also wanted to improve my skill with reactjs, but i talk about it in the frontend repository.
